  FFmpeg is the leading multimedia framework, able to <strong>decode</strong>, <strong>encode</strong>, <strong>
    transcode</strong>, <strong>mux</strong>, <strong>demux</strong>, <strong>stream</strong>, <strong>filter</strong> and <strong>play</strong> pretty much anything
  that humans and machines have created. It supports the most obscure
  ancient formats up to the cutting edge. No matter if they were
  designed by some standards committee, the community or a corporation. It is
  also highly portable: FFmpeg compiles, runs, and passes our testing infrastructure
  <a href="http://fate.ffmpeg.org">FATE</a> across Linux, Mac OS X,
  Microsoft Windows, the BSDs, Solaris, etc. under a wide variety of build
  environments, machine architectures, and configurations.
</p>

<p class="info">It contains libavcodec, libavutil, libavformat, libavfilter, libavdevice,
  libswscale and libswresample which can be used by applications.
  As well as ffmpeg, ffplay and ffprobe which can be used by
  end users for <strong>transcoding</strong> and <strong>playing</strong>.

  The FFmpeg project tries to provide the best technically possible
  solution for developers of applications and end users alike. To achieve
  this we combine the best free software options available. We slightly
  favor our own code to keep the dependencies on other libs low and to
  maximize code sharing between parts of FFmpeg.
  Wherever the question of "best" cannot be answered we support both
  options so the end user can choose.
</p>

<p class="info">Everyone is welcome in FFmpeg and all contributions are welcome too.
  We are happy to receive patches, pull requests, bug reports, donations
  or any other type of contribution.

  Security is a high priority and code review is always done with
  security in mind. Though due to the very large amounts of code touching
  untrusted data security issues are unavoidable and thus we provide
  as quick as possible updates to our last stable releases when
  new security issues are found.
