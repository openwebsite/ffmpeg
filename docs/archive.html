  <h3 id="news-30122012">December 30, 2012, Recent Developments</h3>
  <p>
    Before this year ends we want to use the occasion and give you some news about
    recent developments in FFmpeg.
  </p>

  <h4>
    - <a href="/ffmpeg-filters.html#subtitles">subtitles filter</a>
  </h4>
  <p>
    The subtitles filter makes it possible to merge subtitles supported by
    libavformat/libavcodec into a video stream. This process is also known
    as burning them into the video or simply hardsubbing. This filter depends
    on libass and thus is only available in builds configured with --enable-ass.
  </p>
  <p>
    The subtitles filter is also useful to play external subtitle files with
    ffplay. An example of this usage can be found in the following entry about
    TED captions.
  </p>

  <h4>
    - JSON <a href="ffmpeg-formats.html#tedcaptions">captions for TED talks</a> decoding support
  </h4>
  <p>
    <a href="http://www.ted.com/">TED</a> provides video downloads for their talks.
    Not all of these are available with subtitles and when they are the subtitles
    are burnt into the video. Now with this new FFmpeg feature you can download the
    subtitle files and just display them on the fly when playing the video with ffplay:
  </p>
  <pre>
    ffplay ted.mp4 -vf subtitles=ted.json
  </pre>

  <h4>
    - <a href="/ffmpeg-filters.html#geq">geq filter</a> ported from libmpcodecs
  </h4>
  <p>
    This is another filter ported from MPlayer. It allows you to arbitrarily
    change luma and chroma values for each pixel of the movie individually.
    To learn more look at the
    <a href="/ffmpeg-filters.html#geq">geq documentation</a>
    and
    <a href="ffmpeg-utils.html#Expression-Evaluation">the evaluation syntax description</a>.
    Do not forget to give it a try:
  </p>
  <pre>
    ffplay input.movie -vf "geq=p(X\,Y):if(gt(Y\,H/2)\,128)+ifnot(gt(Y\,H/2)\,cr(X\,Y)):if(gt(Y\,H/2)\,128)+ifnot(gt(Y\,H/2)\,cb(X\,Y))"
  </pre>

  <h4>
    - filter for <a href="/ffmpeg-filters.html#ebur128">loudness analysis following EBU R128</a>
  </h4>
  <p>
    This filter analyses audio streams as recommended by EBU recommendation R128.
    The output can be either logged or visualized in a generated video stream.
  </p>

  <h4>
    - <a href="/ffserver.html#What-is-FFM_002c-FFM2">FFM2</a> support
  </h4>
  <p>
    The FFM2 format has been introduced to provide better interoperability
    between different versions of the FFmpeg tools. It is usually used to
    provide input to ffserver. It improves on its predecessor FFM by making
    the format backward-compatible and extensible. This means the generated
    files are are no longer dependant on specific FFmpeg versions.
  </p>

  <h4>
    - Opus encoder using libopus
  </h4>
  <p>
    You can encode Opus now via Xiph's
    <a href="http://opus-codec.org/development/">libopus</a>.
  </p>

  <h4>
    - VobSub demuxer
  </h4>
  <p>
    IDX/SUB file pairs can now be played back or be remuxed into other formats such as MKV.
  </p>

  <h4>
    - Resolution &amp; pixel format change support with multithreading for H.264
  </h4>
  <p>
    Finally H.264 with resolution and/or pixel format changes can be decoded multithreaded.
  </p>

  <h4>
    - <a href="documentation.html">documentation</a> split into per-component manuals
  </h4>
  <p>
    In an on-going effort, the documentation is split, reordered and extended
    to make it more accessible and more complete.
  </p>

  <p>
    Of course we can't possibly cover all changes since our last release in a single news
    article, but we encourage you to read the
    <a href="http://git.videolan.org/?p=ffmpeg.git;a=blob_plain;f=Changelog">Changelog</a>
    yourself.
  </p>

  <p>
    <i>We wish you all a happy new year!</i>
  </p>

  <h3 id="logo_art_contest_winter-2012">November 14, 2012, Winter Website Banner Contest</h3>
  <p>
    As the days are getting shorter for some of us, we are proud to announce

<b>new release: <a href="download.html#release_0.8">FFmpeg 0.8</a></b>!
All bugfixes and merges from ffmpeg-mt and libav are included in this release.
Although we still recommend you use the latest git version of our code.
</p>
<p>
We have also made an
<b>OLDABI release: <a href="download.html#release_0.7">FFmpeg 0.7.1</a></b>.
It contains almost all of the features, bugfixes and merges of ffmpeg-mt and libav of 0.8,
while being compatible with the 0.6 ABI and API. It has a few missing features,
read the Changelog for more information.
</p>

<h3 id="x264_presets">May 3, 2011</h3>
<p>
FFmpeg now accesses x264 presets via libx264. This extends functionality by
introducing several new libx264 options including <i>-preset</i>, <i>-tune</i>,
and <i>-profile</i>. You can read more detailed information about these options
with "x264 --fullhelp".
</p>

<p>
The syntax has changed so be sure to update your commands. Example:
</p>
<pre>
ffmpeg -i input -vcodec libx264 -preset fast -tune film -profile main -crf 22 -threads 0 output
</pre>

<h3 id="oldabi">April 27, 2011</h3>
<p>
FFmpeg now has an oldabi branch. It is updated to master but with the old ABI.
Only fixes that break the old ABI are missing from this branch.
</p>
<p>
To access the oldabi branch, clone FFmpeg, then do
</p>
<pre>
git checkout oldabi
</pre>
<p>
To get back to latest FFmpeg, just run:
</p>
<pre>
git checkout master
</pre>

<h3 id="tenbith264">April 14, 2011</h3>
<p>
FFmpeg can now decode 9-bit and 10-bit H.264 streams,
used in particular by AVCIntra 50.
</p>

<h3 id="rc_0.6.90">April 4, 2011</h3>
<p>
In order to supply our release users with the newest features and bug
fixes we are in the process of making a new release. The release will
be based on the latest development tree while staying API/ABI compatible
to the previous release.
</p><p>
Please <a href="download.html#release_0.6">download</a> the release candidate and report problems to our <a href="bugreports.html">bug tracker</a>.
</p>

<h3 id="win32_builds">March 30, 2011</h3>
<p>
Win32 and Win64 builds of FFmpeg are now available at
<a href="http://ffmpeg.zeranoe.com/builds/">http://ffmpeg.zeranoe.com/builds/</a>
</p>

<p>
Please report any bugs to our
<a href="https://trac.ffmpeg.org">bug tracker</a>.
</p>

<h3 id="mt_merge">March 21, 2011</h3>

<p>
Today <a href="http://gitorious.org/ffmpeg/ffmpeg-mt">FFmpeg-mt</a>, the
multithreaded decoding branch, has been merged into FFmpeg. This has been
a long awaited merge, and we would like to thank Alexander Strange for his
patience and hard work.
</p>

<p>
Testing is appreciated and if you find any bugs please report them to our
<a href="/bugreports.html">bug tracker</a>.

<h3 id="mailing_list_migration">March 21, 2011</h3>

<p>
The mailing lists have been fully migrated to ffmpeg.org!
</p>
<p>
The FFmpeg mailing lists were moved from sourceforge.net to
mplayerhq.hu in April 2005, and moved from mplayerhq.hu
to ffmpeg.org in 2011.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately the lists were down for a few hours
because of the abrupt shut down on the previous server[1].
We apologize for this interruption. Also we could not move
the subscribers of the
<a href="https://lists.ffmpeg.org/mailman/listinfo/libav-user/">libav-user</a>
mailing list (libav-user is for application developers
using libav* libraries from the FFmpeg project).
Even though
<a href="https://lists.ffmpeg.org/mailman/listinfo/libav-user/">libav-user</a>
was not listed in the shut down announcement[1], it was also
shut down.
</p>
<p>
If you are not yet subscribed we encourage you to do so now if
you are interested in FFmpeg or multimedia or both. Visit our
<a href="contact.html">contacts page</a> to find out more about
the various mailing lists surrounding the FFmpeg project.
You can also find the archives there if you like to browse the old posts.
</p>
<p>
As stated in the previous news entry we are in the process
of recovering our project infrastructure. We will keep you
posted.

Reinhard Tartler backported several security fixes to the 0.5 release branch and
made another point release, that is <a href="download.html#release_0.5">0.5.4</a>. Note, 0.5
is quite old and this release is mostly for those stuck with the 0.5 branch,
and not so interesting for end users.
</p>
<pre>
    Changelog between 0.5.3 and 0.5.4

- Fix memory corruption in WMV parsing (addresses CVE-2010-3908)
- Fix heap corruption crashes (addresses CVE-2011-0722)
- Fix crashes in Vorbis decoding found by zzuf (addresses CVE-2010-4704)

<h3 id="return_to_freedom">March 15, 2011</h3>

<p>
FFmpeg has been forked by some developers after their attempted
takeover[1] two months ago did not fully succeed. During these two months their repository
was listed here as main FFmpeg repository. We corrected this now and list
the actual main repository and theirs directly below. All improvements of their fork
have been merged into the main repository already.
</p><p>
Sadly we lost a not so minor part of our infrastructure to the forking side.
We are still in the process of recovering, but web, git and issue tracker are
already replaced.
</p><p>
Readers who want to find out more about the recent happenings are encouraged to
read through the archives of the FFmpeg development mailing list[2]. There was
also a bit of coverage on some news sites like here [3].

<h3 id="svn_to_git">February 24, 2011</h3>

<p>
FFmpeg development has moved to Git, and the SVN repository is no longer
updated. The SVN repository may be removed in a near future, so you're
recommended to use a <a href="/download.html">Git repository</a> instead.
</p>

<p>
The last revision committed to SVN was r26402 on 2011-01-19 and replaced
the svn:external libswscale with a standalone copy.
</p>

<h3 id="release_0.6.1">Oct 18, 2010</h3>

<p>
We have just pushed the first point release from our 0.6 release branch:
<a href="download.html#release_0.6">FFmpeg 0.6.1</a>. This is a
maintenance-only release that addresses a small number of bugs and security
issues. It also adds a newer version of the AAC decoder, which enables the
playback of HE-AAC v2 media.
</p>

<p>
We have also taken the time make another point release our 0.5 branch:
<a href="download.html#release_0.5">FFmpeg 0.5.3</a>.
It is a maintenance-only release that addresses a security issue and a
minor set of bugs.
</p>

<p>
Distributors and system integrators are encouraged to update and share their
patches against our release branches.
</p>


<h3 id="release_0.6">June 15, 2010</h3>

<p>
A bit longer than actually expected, but finally, we are proud to announce
a <b>new release: <a href="download.html#release_0.6">FFmpeg 0.6</a></b>. Check out
the <a href="releases/ffmpeg-0.6.release">release notes</a> and

<h3 id="linuxtag_2010">June 2, 2010</h3>
<p>
We are pleased to announce that FFmpeg will be present at LinuxTag in
Berlin June 9-12 where we will be showing some spectacular demos.
There will also be some trolls.
</p>

<h3 id="release_0.5.2">May 25, 2010</h3>
<p>
We have just pushed out another point release from our 0.5 release branch:
<a href="download.html#release_0.5">FFmpeg 0.5.2</a>.
This is a maintenance-only release that addresses a small number of security
and portability issues. Distributors and system integrators are encouraged
to update and share their patches against this branch.
</p>

<h3 id="gsoc_2010">March 19, 2010</h3>
<p>
Once again, FFmpeg has been accepted to take part in the
<a href="http://code.google.com/soc/">Google Summer of Code</a>. Here is the
<a href="http://socghop.appspot.com/org/show/google/gsoc2010/ffmpeg">Google SoC
FFmpeg page</a>.
</p>
<p>
We have a list of
<a href="http://wiki.multimedia.cx/index.php?title=FFmpeg_Summer_Of_Code_2010">
proposed project ideas</a> available so, if you think you might be interested,
head over there to see if there is any project on which you wish to work and for
which you may wish to make an application. The list is still in flux, and you're
free to come up with your own ideas, but note that proposals should be closely
tied to the progression of FFmpeg's code base.
</p>
<p>
We would like prospective students to show us that they've got what it takes
to be a contributor to FFmpeg. If you think you're suited, then please complete
a <a href="http://wiki.multimedia.cx/index.php?title=Small_FFmpeg_Tasks">small
task</a> before submitting your Summer-of-Code proposal. Note that many of the
proposed Summer-of-Code projects have specific tasks that you would want to work
on, since they would show us that you're comfortable in that particular piece of
our codebase that relates to your specific project. Send patches to the mailing
list for review, so that you will learn about our patch review process,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posting_style#Inline_replying">inline
replying</a> (because we don't like top-posting on our mailing lists) and general
interactions with our developer base.
</p>
<p>
The sooner you start communicating with us and working within
our code base, the sooner both you and we will ascertain your suitability and
you will get used to our development methodology. You have until the application
deadline to complete your small task. Good luck!
</p>

<h3 id="release_0.5.1">March 2, 2010</h3>
<p>
We have just pushed out a point release from our 0.5 release
branch: <a href="download.html#release_0.5">FFmpeg 0.5.1</a>. This
release fixes security, packaging and licensing issues for FFmpeg 0.5,
but it is a maintenance only release; no new codecs, formats or other
feature are being introduced. The full details are spelled out in the
the <a href="releases/ffmpeg-0.5.1.release">release notes</a>
and <a href="releases/ffmpeg-0.5.1.changelog">changelog</a>.
</p>

<p>
There have been security fixes for the ASF, Ogg and MOV/MP4 demuxers
as well as the FFv1, H.264, HuffYUV, MLP, MPEG audio and Snow
decoders. libswscale can now be compiled in LGPL mode, albeit with
x86 optimizations disabled. Some non-free bits in a test program were
replaced. The AC-3 decoder is now completely LGPL. AMR-NB/WB support
is now possible in free software through the OpenCORE libraries.
</p>

<p>
To help packagers, the x264 glue code was updated to work with newer
versions and symbol versioning was backported, as was the lock
management API. The symbol versioning change is enabled on platforms
that support it. This allows users to upgrade from 0.5.1 to the
upcoming 0.6 release without having to recompile their applications.
While this release is both API and ABI compatible with 0.5, please
note that distributors have to recompile applications against 0.5.1
in order to make seamless upgrades to 0.6 possible.
</p>


<h3>March 1, 2010</h3>
<p>
We have been busy over the past few months. Among other things, the
results are an Indeo 5 video decoder as well as audio decoders for
AMR-NB, Sipro, MPEG-4 ALS and WMA Voice, complete support for Bink,
CDG and IFF PBM/ILBM bitmaps, an RTSP muxer, Bluray (PGS) subtitle
support, a protocol for file concatenation and the ffprobe tool for
extracting information from multimedia files.
</p>

<h3>September 23, 2009</h3>
<p>
In 1992 Sony introduced the first Minidisc player. 17 years later it is now
possible to transfer and play back the raw ATRAC data from the actual digital
disc with the help of FFmpeg, tools developed by the
<a href="https://wiki.physik.fu-berlin.de/linux-minidisc/doku.php">Linux
 Minidisc project</a> and official hardware (MZ-RH1). So if you have lots of digital
recordings stored on Minidisc now is the time to archive it all.
</p>

<p>
One of the last entrenchments of proprietary multimedia has fallen: Windows Media
Audio Pro support is finally available in FFmpeg. It decodes all known samples
flawlessly and is considerably faster than the binary decoder from Microsoft.
A big thank you goes out to all the reverse engineers and programmers who made
this possible. It really was a herculean effort.
</p>


<h3>August 24, 2009</h3>
<p>
Just a very short time after its launch (~10 years), FFmpeg now supports
decoding of TwinVQ (remember .vqf files?). Now FOSS enthusiasts can finally
contribute to the late 90's discussion if it sounds better than MP3 or not.
</p>

<h3>July 24, 2009</h3>
<p>
FFmpeg has removed support for
<a href="http://www.penguin.cz/~utx/amr">libamr</a> as of svn revision 19365. It
has been replaced with support for
<a href="http://opencore-amr.sourceforge.net/">libopencore-amr</a>. Naturally
the configure options have changed. The libamr options have been removed and
there are two new options to take their place:
</p>
<ul>
<li>--enable-libopencore-amrnb</li>
<li>--enable-libopencore-amrwb</li>
</ul>
<p>
The reason for this change is that the libamr license was non-free, while
libopencore-amr is licensed under an Apache 2 license. The change was
<a href="http://lists.mplayerhq.hu/pipermail/ffmpeg-devel/2009-May/069779.html">
discussed at length</a> on the developer mailing list during May, June, and
July. This has several effects:
</p>
<ul>
<li>You may now distribute FFmpeg builds with support for dynamically loading
    libopencore-amr</li>
<li>Support for AMR-WB encoding has been removed since libopencore-amr does not
    support it</li>
</ul>

It has been a very long time since we last made a release and many did not think
we would make one again but, back by popular demand, we are proud to announce
a <b>new release: <a href="download.html#release_0.5">FFmpeg 0.5</a></b>. Check out

<h3>March 4, 2009</h3>
<p>
Google are again running their <a href="http://code.google.com/soc/">Summer of
Code</a> program and, as usual, we will be applying for a project position. As
such we will need strong
<a href="http://wiki.multimedia.cx/index.php?title=FFmpeg_Summer_Of_Code_2009">
project proposals</a> and qualification tasks for the students to complete.
</p>
<p>
To all the students out there who want to work on FFmpeg over the summer, the
sooner you begin to contribute to the project the better. Working on digital
multimedia software is not the easiest task and getting code into FFmpeg's trunk
repository demands significant rigor and commitment.
</p>
<p>
Until we are officially accepted into the program, you could take a look at the
list of
<a href="http://wiki.multimedia.cx/index.php?title=Small_FFmpeg_Tasks">small
tasks</a> we have and try to complete one of those. Support for development of
FFmpeg is available via <a href="contact.html">the FFmpeg-devel mailing list or
IRC</a>.
</p>

<h3>December 20, 2008</h3>
<p>
RealVideo 3.0 decoder added.
Still working the bugs out, please test and report any problems.
</p>

<h3>December 20, 2008</h3>
<p>
The FFmpeg project would like to recognize
and thank the people at <a href="http://www.picsearch.com/">Picsearch</a>
for their help improving FFmpeg recently. The Picsearch team makes extensive
use of FFmpeg and provided feedback to FFmpeg in the form of thousands of files
that either crash FFmpeg or use unsupported/unknown codecs. The FFmpeg
development team is putting this information to work in order to improve
FFmpeg for everyone.
</p>

<p>
We know that there are other organizations using FFmpeg on a large scale
to process diverse input types. The FFmpeg team invites those
organizations to provide similar feedback about problems encountered in
the wild.
</p>

<h3>December 3, 2008</h3>
<p>
A bunch of new formats have recently been
added to FFmpeg, namely a QCELP/PureVoice speech decoder, a floating point
PCM decoder and encoder, a Nellymoser ASAO encoder, an Electronic Arts TGQ
decoder, Speex decoding via libspeex, an MXF muxer, an ASS/SSA subtitle demuxer
and muxer and our AC-3 decoder has been extended with E-AC-3 support. Last but
not least we now have a decoder for RealVideo 4.0.
</p>

<h3>September 8, 2008</h3>
<p>
FFmpeg is undergoing major changes in its
API/ABI. The last valid revision for libavcodec version 51 is r15261.
</p>

<h3>August 21, 2008</h3>
<p>
The AAC decoder from FFmpeg Summer of Code
2006 has finally been cleaned up and is now in FFmpeg trunk. It supports Main
and Low Complexity profile AAC but does not yet support HE AAC v1 (LC + SBR) or
v2 (LC + SBR + PS), though implementation of this support is underway. It is
considerably faster than FAAD and you should expect further performance
improvements and bug fixes in the coming weeks.
</p>

<p>
Also, FFmpeg now has floating point PCM support and supports MLP/TrueHD decoding
(FFmpeg SoC 2008 should bring us an encoder), Apple Lossless Audio encoding
(FFmpeg SoC 2008) MVI demuxing and Motion Pixels Video decoding, D-Cinema audio
muxing, Electronic Arts CMV and TGV decoding and MAXIS EA XA demuxing/decoding.
</p>

<h3>June 16, 2008</h3>
<p>
UAB "DKD" (dkd.lt) have released a Nellymoser
ASAO compatible <a href="http://samples.mplayerhq.hu/A-codecs/Nelly_Moser/ASAO/ASAO.zip">decoder and
encoder</a> under the LGPL. This will aid the development of a native encoder in
FFmpeg, and right now a GSoC student is working hard on just that task. A great
thanks to UAB "DKD" for this contribution to the FFmpeg community.
</p>

<h3>June 11, 2008</h3>
<p>
We have added an Oma demuxer, the QuickTime
variant of an IMA ADPCM encoder, a VFW grabber, an iPod/iPhone-compatible MP4
muxer, a Mimic decoder, an MSN TCP Webcam stream demuxer as well as demuxers
and decoders for the following fringe formats: RL2, IFF, 8SVX, BFI.
</p>

<h3>February 7, 2008</h3>
<p>
We have added Ogg and AVM2 (Flash 9)
SWF muxers, TechnoTrend PVA and Linux Media Labs MPEG-4 (LMLM4) demuxers,
PC Paintbrush PCX and Sun Rasterfile decoders.
</p>

<h3>November 11, 2007</h3>
<p>
FFmpeg now supports XIntra8 frames,
meaning that finally all WMV2 samples and some WMV3 samples that showed
blocky color artifacts can be decoded correctly.
</p>

<h3>October 22, 2007</h3>
<p>
Beam Software SIFF demuxer and video decoder
support added.
</p>

<h3>October 15, 2007</h3>
<p>
FFmpeg gets support for the Nellymoser
speech codec used in flash.
</p>

<h3>October 9, 2007</h3>
<p>
Apart from a DNxHD encoder, PAFF decoding
support for H.264 was committed to SVN.
</p>

<h3>September 29, 2007</h3>
<p>
AMV audio and video decoding has arrived.
</p>

<h3>September 13, 2007</h3>
<p>
In about half a year of work since the
last update we have added among other things: DXA and Monkey's Audio demuxer
and decoder, DNxHD, Atrac3 and AC-3 decoders, QTRLE encoder, NUT and Matroska
muxers.
</p>

<h3>July 14, 2007</h3>
<p>
FFmpeg got 8 projects this year in the Google
Summer of Code program. Check out the
<a href="http://code.google.com/soc/ffmpeg/about.html">FFmpeg SoC about page</a>
for more information.
</p>

<h3>March 09, 2007</h3>
<p>
Nine months without news but with heavy
development. A few select highlights are decoders for VC-1/WMV3/WMV9, VMware,
VP5, VP6 video and WavPack, IMC, DCA audio and a WMA encoder.
