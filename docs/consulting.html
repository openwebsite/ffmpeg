  If you're running a business that uses FFmpeg or would like to use FFmpeg,
  you will sometimes want to have an expert, i.e. one of the original
  developers, work with you to figure out an issue, fix a bug or add
  some new feature.
</p>

<p class="with-icon">
  <span class="pull-right"><i class="fa fa-users fa-5x"></i></span>
  This page is a list of those FFmpeg developers that are available for
  employment or consulting. The FFmpeg project highly recommends these people
  to be hired by your business. All developers on this list maintain some
  code in FFmpeg,
  which serves as a testimony for their competence. By hiring one of these
  developers, your business can also (indirectly) support the development
  of FFmpeg.

  <span class="pull-left"><i class="fa fa-question-circle fa-5x"></i></span>
  If you do not know whom to hire in particular or if none of the listed
  areas of expertise fits your requirements, you can send an email to
  the <a href="contact.html">ffmpeg-devel mailing list</a>, where it will
  reach a wider audience.
